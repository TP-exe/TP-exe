Hello @Tp-exe here, I am new to Python and learning it. I am also learning about GitHub, so my projects fn are private.  🔏

I am going for machine learning in the future and Python is a go-to language...👌

I am 15 by the way, and learning Python as with my other studies just for fun and make my lot easier for me...🎭

I am looking over making my GitHub repository public in a year or so when I have learned Python to a good extent. 🤖
